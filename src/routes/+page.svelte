		<div class="flex flex-col gap-2 text-justify">
			<p>
				IIOT started in Italy and has been an international competition since 2017. It aims to fill
				an important gap, as there was previously no prestigious programming team competition for
				high school students comparable to the ICPC university competition. However, the problems
				are similar to tasks in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
			</p>
			<p>
				The competition emphasizes teamwork, creativity, and collaborative learning â€” skills
				essential in the modern workforce. It includes four online rounds, a national final, and an
				international onsite contest. Each country is coordinated by a leader school or organization
				with support from the international scientific committee. The number of participating
				countries is constantly increasing. To get involved, feel free to reach out to
				<a href="mailto:iio.team@iio.team" class="btn-link link-secondary">iio.team@iio.team</a>.
