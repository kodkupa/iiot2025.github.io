	<h2 class="text-2xl sm:divider">About IIOT</h2>
	<p>
		IIOT started in Italy and has been an international competition since 2017. It aims to fill an
		important gap, as there was previously no prestigious programming team competition for high
		school students comparable to the ICPC university competition. However, the problems are similar
		to tasks in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
	</p>
	<p>
		The competition emphasizes teamwork, creativity, and collaborative learning â€” skills essential
		in the modern workforce. It includes four online rounds, a national final, and an international
		onsite contest. Each country is coordinated by a leader school or organization with support from
		the international scientific committee. The number of participating countries is constantly
		increasing. To get involved, feel free to reach out to
